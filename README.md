*DESCRIPTION*

The objective is to analyze and visualize credit card complaints to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights. Using a dataset containing customer complaints related to credit card services, the goal is to identify common issues, track complaint resolution times, and analyze customer sentiments. The dashboard will include interactive visualizations such as trend charts, geographic maps, and category-wise breakdowns to highlight the most frequent complaints, affected regions, and response effectiveness. By transforming raw complaint data into meaningful insights, this project aims to provide financial institutions with a clearer understanding of customer pain points, helping them improve service quality and customer satisfaction.
